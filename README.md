## Selenium-twitter

A repo for me to practice some web testing automation stuff, targeting (bumblebee)[https://github.com/Bumblebee/Bumblebee]/(selenium)[http://www.seleniumhq.org/]

I'll be using the bumblebee reddit examples

not sure that this will turn out to be - slow twitter cli client, slow twitter api reimplementation without limits/auth? nothing at all? we'll see.
